# Getting to the next step in my career

I have been a software developer for nearly 5 years now and during that time (like many others), I thought about what it would be like to switch companies and see the "other side" of things. This thought came into my head time and time again and I never truly acted on it until just recently. It took me about 3 years of going back and forth between studying and reading various materials to finally become consistent with a practice routine.

All this to say that for anyone reading this, there is hope and you can certainly achieve whatever it is you want to achieve as long as you're willing and able to put in the time.

I was recently rejected from a company that I truly wanted to work for. My dream company if you will. What I learned from that rejection is the following:

- A rejection does not define your ability as a software engineer
- Getting to an onsite to begin with is an achievement in and of itself
- There is always room to grow, no matter the position you're aiming for or the one you ultimately get

That being said, I now am on the other side of that rejection and after giving myself some time to ponder, it's time to move forward with a new and refreshed attitude.
