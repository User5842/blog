# gameshare log[0]

It's one of those days where I am _highly_ inspired to _finally_ get around to making my project: gameshare.

Because I have created this blog, what better way to document my progress than by writing posts about it, I genuinely hope that in this way, I can keep myself accountable.

Okay, so what _is_ gameshare?

gameshare is a platform for gamers (primarily those on Xbox) to connect and share their digital libraries.

I do this with my brother, and it works out well. We get to divide the cost of games and end up playing a lot more than we usually would.

After looking around to see if there were similar projects and communities, I came across some but none that were active and formalized.

My intention with this platform is to allow authorized users (those with Microsoft accounts) to see what other gamers are sharing and match with them to inherit their library.

The repository is located [here](https://github.com/User5842/gameshare), and you can track my progress directly on GitHub and this blog.

Looking forward to the next post! :)
